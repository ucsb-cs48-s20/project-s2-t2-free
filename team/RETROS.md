# Retro 04/20/20

- Led by: Clare Boyle
- Present: Corey Su, Ishana Narayanan, Vincent Tieu
- Absent: --

## Action item

- a goal: Keep each other updated on the tutorials we are going through and create documentation for the application.
- a change: Create a Shared Google Drive for the team to share notes / documentation from tutorials
- a measurement: The TutorialProgress spreadsheet will help make us accountable for the tutorials we have completed.

## Retro Assessment

- My team and I followed the Start/Stop/Continue template for our first retro using GroupMaps to outline our thoughts and feelings about this process so far.
- I think it went relatively well. We were able to identify pretty quickly that we all wanted to continue working through tutorials, but needed a way of consolidating all the information we're learning. Based on my team's concerns, I create a Google Folder with an excel file labeled TutorialProgress and shared it with the rest of my team.
- I would recommend figuring out what template you want to follow beforehand since I think it helped even if we didn't use it extensively.

## Action item

- a goal: Create a better way to prepare / create issues for future implementations of our app
- a change: Drawing out / writing out plans on pen and paper (or some other method) then sending a photo on Slack
- a measurement: During sprint meetings take on new issues and review progress at end of sprint time-span

## Brief description of how retro went

Retro leader fill this in.

- My team and I followed the Start/Stop/Continue template for this retro.
- I think this retro went relatively well as we were able to talk among each other about things that were useful to us (ex. continuing peer programming) and things that weren't and should be stopped (ex. tutorial spreadsheet). We were able to address these things and document them in our shared Google Drive.
- I would recommend the next person leading the retro to keep the meeting focused on team dynamics and have other discussions saved for a future standup meeting or for a separate call.

## Action item

* a goal: Create better User Interface for our app 
* a change: A major issue we have is that we want to work on UI, but we don't have a list of attributes we need to work on to improve it. In this case, we created a Google Doc so we have somewhere we can quickly and easily add the many little things we want to change for UI that can be transferred to our Kanban board as we work on each issue.
* a measurement: Since improvement on UI is pretty subjective, we've chosen to measure this change through the number of changes we make and complete on the Kanban board. Since we've been using the Kanban board since the beginning of the quarter, we can compare how much we implement in the next two weeks to previous weeks.

## Retro Assessment

* My team and I followed Darby/Larsen’s five stages of a successful retro since some feedback from our first Retro was to "focus on making future retros more structured."
* I think everyone is pretty happy with the progress we've made so far and our communication level; however, this made it difficult to decide on what we want to change or improve upon which is the point of the Retro.
* I recommend a Retro with less guidelines, but that provides better direction in terms of Retro goals. I really liked facilitating the Start/Stop/Continue Retro from before, but I think this Retro left something to be desired. I think it was harder because it dictated a lot of little things that made the meeting feel more artificial and wasn't condusive to making organic discussion.
